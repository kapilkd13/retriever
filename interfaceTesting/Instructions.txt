This is a Test sample for Python Interface for retriever.

Currently Install, Fetch and ListScript function has been defined in this test sample. This code is present in interface.py module in retriever directory

Right now using this sample code we can fetch, install data from/in CSV, JSON, MYSQL, SQLITE, POSTGRES databases.

This sample code has been tested on 'iris' and  'bird-size' datasets

To use this sample retriever package:

We need following libraries

1. sqlalchemy : pip install sqlalchemy
2. pandas :pip install pandas
3. Pymysql : pip install pymysql


Steps involved:

1. clone this repository.
2. cd retriever
3. pip uninstall retriever    =>if you have a retriever package
4. sudo python setup.py install or sudo pip install . => To create a retriever package

 Code to test this implementation is also included in this repository in retriever/pythonInterface directory

5. Make appropriate changes in Connection.conn file (for mysql and postgres)

6. cd pythonInterface

7. python checkInterface.py

Output of all functions will be printed to console

Test code is present in retriever/pythonInterface/checkInterface.py file
